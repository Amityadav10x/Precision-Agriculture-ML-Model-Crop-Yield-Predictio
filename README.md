## 🎯 Overview

This project addresses the challenge of optimal crop selection in agriculture by leveraging machine learning to analyze environmental factors and recommend the best crops for specific conditions.

**Problem Statement:**  
Farmers often struggle to determine which crops will thrive in their specific soil and climate conditions, leading to reduced yields and wasted resources.

**Solution:**  
An AI-powered recommendation system that analyzes 7 environmental parameters to predict the most suitable crop with 99.77% accuracy.
